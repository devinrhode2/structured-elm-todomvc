    <!-- You cannot put ports.js, which initializes elm, in the <head> tag, otherwise it will run
        into a bug where I think document.body is undefined.
        Ember puts scripts at the bottom and that has been a good way to do it for as far as I can remember.
        It'd be better to keep the scripts together so it's clear where someone might add more scripts.
